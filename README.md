# CriminalRecords
#### This is a smaller javafx application for managing criminals and criminal records. The project was developed using a three-tier software development architecture. A bottom-up approach was used during the development of the application. First, the database design was completed, then the business logic, and finally the user interface. 
#### In the terminal, start the program by typing the following 2 commands:
#### mvn clean install, mvn clean javafx:run
